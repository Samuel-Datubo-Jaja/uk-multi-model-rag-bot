## 🚧 StructureGPT: AI Assistant for UK Building Regulations
A Multi-Model Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System Fine-Tuned for Domain-Specific Compliance Guidance

## 🔍 Overview
StructureGPT is a powerful, modular AI assistant designed to simplify access to UK Building Regulations. It compares three LLaMA-based language model configurations — including a LoRA fine-tuned model — in a shared RAG pipeline, enabling accurate, grounded, and efficient responses to complex regulatory queries.

## 🚀 Features
### ✅ Multi-Model RAG System: Supports LLaMA-3.3-70B, LLaMA3-8B via GROQ API, and a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B.
### ✅ Unified Streamlit Interface: Seamlessly switch between models and explore real-time comparisons.
### ✅ Hybrid Retrieval: 70% vector search (ChromaDB + all-mpnet-base-v2) + 30% BM25 keyword matching.
### ✅ Fine-Tuning with LoRA + Quantization: Efficient domain adaptation with 3,000 curated Q&A pairs.
### ✅ Fully Transparent Output: Source attribution, response times, and performance metrics included.
